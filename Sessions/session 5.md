## Day 1 (stillÂ²), near dusk
continue walking toward the [Tser Pool](../Places/Tser%20Pool.md) camp

the tser pool is, unsurprisingly, a small lake/pool.

we can feel the terrain getting muddier, the road fades intoa  muddy path through the trees.
tracks of wagons passing through.

as we continue, clearing next to river forming a small lake (few 100ft across)
5 colorful round tents, 10ft diameter, outside ring of 4 barreltopped wagons
sound of an accordion, neither happy nor sad.
around the bonfire, several brightly dressed figures.

we agree that this is almost certainly the camp we seek.

first person who catches out eyes: man in his 40s, quite similar to stanimir (old man who brought us to barovia). and some new faces. mix of men, women. minding their own business.

we approach the familiar looking guy. as we step inside hearing range, they notice us. they turn their heads to look at us; they smile and wave.

greetings. we explain: we're here to see madam eva. he points at the biggest tent, which has an elegant rug on it.

we go in. after some discussion, ireena goes in with us.

crystal ball on low desk
hunched figure (eva) peering into its depths
as we step in, she raises her head, looks at us, smiles, and crreaks: "at last you arrived!"
she bids us sit down; including Ireena, who introduces herself.
as soon as madam eva notices the raven, her facial features soften, expressing fondness. she asks to inspect the raven; quiyra and the raven accept. Madam Eva strokes its wings and it hangs out on the table, inspecting things.
she used to have a pet raven, named turul. she's only seen him once these past 10yrs. he's surely gone wild without her.

fortune telling
worn deck of cards from under table. eva closes eyes. they flash open. her voice a low hiss.

a shadow is approaching my tent. a lone servant of darkness. they seek secrets of your future, which i am sworn never to reveal to anyone else.
if they learn of what we discuss all may be lost. do not reveal even that you know of their true nature, else strahd will know. i will read cards first, and you will listen closely, for I shall never repeat what I say here.

she removes 14 cards, sets them aside
remaining cards she shuffles a few times
both decks on the surface of the table. closes her eyes, right hand over the larger pile. flames dim and swirl in eldritch patterns, her lips move silently. tension in air. sounds from outside dim. space within grows more solid and real.

slowly she draws 3 cards, face down, separately.

2 more cards from the smaller pile. 1st, below the 3, forming a cross. 2nd, in the center.

leftmost card: cerulean blue
history. knowledge of the ancients will help us understand our enemy.
The Torturer, 9 of swords. a scowling, bearded man clad in leather and a spike-tipped hood. callous, gnarled hands turn the wheel of a grim device.
there is a town where all is not well. there, we will find a house of corruption, and withi, a dark room full of ?stale ghosts?

second card, the top: cheery yellow
a powerful force for good&protection. a holy symbol of great hope.
The myrmidon, 5 of swords. armored warrior clutching a cracked iron sword + leatherbound wooden shield, face obscured by heavy iron helmet.
Look for a den of wolves, in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to Mother Night.

third card, right arm of the cross: darkness then nova of fierce burning white. burns to see.
power and strength. a weapon of vengeance, a sword of sunlight.
The Bishop, 8 of glyphs. a solemn-faced man clad in holy vestments. 1 hand chain of bronze censer.
What you seek lies in a pile of treasure beyond a set of amber doors.

fourth card, bottom of the cross: flames leap and dance, violet embers
sheds light on one who will help you greatly in battle vs darkness
The Mists. quiet graveyard choked with fog, entrance sealed with sharp iron fance
vistana wanders this land alone searching for her mentor. Never stays in one place for long. Seek her at st markovia abbey near the mists.

fifth card, center: light almost swallowed by shadows.
she nearly recoils. your enemy is a creature of darkness,powers beyond mortality. when hour of judgment, this card will lead you to him
(only barely visible) The Marionette. a crowned, grinnign emperor, clad in royal finery, reaching for a goblet of wine, wooden puppet limbs lashed to strings that disappear into the darkness overhead.
look to great heights. find the beating heart of the castle. he waits nearby.

last syllable. she freezes, lolls back in her chair. 

candles, outside sounds return. weak gray light from outside filters in again.
outside, sounds of footsteps.

all her powers are for is reading the threads of fate. she doesn't produce the fortune she told us. she merely shows people what she cards show her.

jasper asks: how did you summon us here? surely that's more than just inferring from the cards. eva: cards told her there is something for each of us that we may find here in barovia. are we willing to have the others hear what we may find, or would we prefer to keep secrets among ourselves?

eva takes the larger deck and starts shuffling it again. she then pulls three cards off of it and puts them in front of us.

eva looks at oliver, slowly and carefully flips a card: The Monk, 1 of Glyphs. the words of the divine fal on deaf ears, baffled by the shadow mists. find the damned one in his place of worship, and free his divine soul from the madness of mortality. she gives him the card. O: bit strange but i think i get it. she smiles.

jasper: The Swashbuckler, 1st of Coins. Alas! I see swirling snow and frigid ice. The reaper's shadow grows long, and moutaintops ring with pleas of a lost soul. J: that doesnt mean a lot to me im sorry. She sighs, understandingly (vibe: I know as much as you do).

Quiyra and Areia: sad sigh, as if pitying. The Necromancer, 8 of Stars. arrow of time moves ever forward, but the warp of magic can render new life to souls of the dead through its weave.
follow light of corpse star, in the place where amber giants sleep.

we ask madam eva if we can stay for the night. we're "more than welcome". we thank her and leave her to rest.

during the reading, the raven was quite nervous, was going around the tent in circles. calmed down once things went back to normal, and flew back on the table.

level up!!

as we leave madam evas'e tent, we see 2 vistani waiting outside: a quite beautiful woman in her early 30s, long silky black hair, curvy; a man, quite frail, late 30s, distant/absent-minded demeanor.

the both look at us. she smiles: welcome to the camp.
the stanimar-looking guy also aproaches. she clicks her tongue, scolds him: where are your manners? they've traveled a long way, why haven t you offered them anything.
Q: its ok, we wanted to talk to eva first anyway.

will we join them for wine, food, fireside? yes, and we were hoping to stay the night anyway.

he introduces himself: his name is stanim. Q: any relation to stanimar? S: you've met my father? how is he? - we have, the old man who drove

woman's name: Eliza. Other guy: Arturi. Oliver introduces most of us (Quiyra has to introduce herself). Ireena introduces herself.

We sit around the fire. other people join, bringing trays of wine, bread, cheese, and pickled beets.

Eliza looks at us and asks what our next destination is. We answer: Vallaki. Then elsewhere, probably following clues from the fortune Madam Eva read us, but we don't know where that is yet.

Arturi asks: we came from Barovia, yes? Do we have news? yes; Quiyra gives a short summary. Have we met a man named Rudolf van Richten? no, not to our knowledge. Arturi explains: old friend of his, he heard rumors that he had come to harm while traveling to Barovia.

stew of rabbit, potat, lentil, turnips, etc

as we eat, stanim looks at us, smiles, says: you know that, as guests of a vistani fire, we're expected to play the game of stories. he explains: put up a wager (coins, an item of intel/sentiment value), share a story to make a man laugh/weep. others must guess whether the story is true, false, or both. at the end, the participant with the most correct guesses wins the pot.

areia agrees to play.

stanim wagers a deck of tarokka cards, from his late wife. they've sat unused and dusty for long enough. I would think she'd like it if they were out in the world again.

eliza wagers a collapsible brass spyglass with mirror to peer around corners. she wants to join too.

arturi takes out a small book. doesn't say anything

ireena: painted wooden hairclip, shape of a flower. she used to wear it as a child.

areia, for lack of a better idea, puts in 2gp.

quiyra wagers a faded pink neckerchief (which belonged to pre-transition oloris)

jasper pulls out the last catalogue from his father's business, and a storybook, from his stash.


stanim goes first. he rubs his hands, getting ready to cast some magic.
one night, a wounded soldier staggered intyo our camp and collapsed. we nursed his unjuuriy and quenched his thirst with wine
we asked who he was, he wouldnt say, just wanted to go home. we were deep in the land of his enemies, so we took him as one of our own and helped him home. enemies hunted him, said he was a prince.
dark figure in the fire, sword drawn.
this man of royal blood.. (he hesitates) we protected him, and bore himsafely to his home, and he said: thanks, i owe you my life. stay as long as you wish, you will always be safe here.
figure kills an enemy, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.

actually: it was true! one of the old tales of the vistani people.

jasper next. gestures at box
story from his father about mimics, inspired box
father was messing with him: real mimics don't run faster than a person, or turn into a chest when they die.

actually: completely false!

eliza now.
it's said that within each raven flutters a lost song, and within each raven ???
so listen closely.
voice quiet, eerie, melodic.
sing, raven of barovia. birther from mists, bathed in twilight
sing of logdana
the holy symbol of ravenkind
sing of chernobog's rise, demon lord of wherever
logdana, grey-haired, weary from battle
she clashed with the demon, their tempest like dance
sing of logdana's last fury
tde turning
hero's last cry, deity's grace, demon lord felled, warrior felled
light's final moments, shadow descending from on high
the morning lord's angel reclaiming its kith
sing, ravens, you are the keepers, the watchers, the tellers of story and sword

actually: half-true

areia:
when i was a kid, i started developing some strange abilities, not often seen back home. soon after, mama disappeared, I still don't quite know what happened to her.
i ended up getting into trouble, but this ended up being quite impactful on my life. because it is where i met my late wife. when i first saw Nem, I was head over heels, and because I was 16 and stupid, I immediately asked her out.
Nem did not reject me and instead told me that if I could be ranked at the top in training, she would accept and go out with me, because she only dated people who were at the top. And I worked my ass off, and did that.
We got married for tax benefits, and then we got married for real. and then, well, she died, and it was rough watching that occur.
and that's the story of why some of my tattoos exist. because i didn't want any of the tattoos of what i once belonged to, and it was only fitting that i showed that I loved her more than I feared them.

arturi:
there was once a silver fox. renwned among all for his curative touch. on a cold moonlight night, though, a rustle of wings dsturbed his reprieve. flock of sparrows bringing one f theirs, tendrils of death clutching it. silverfox took it in, but couldnt save it.
fearing the sparrows' anger, he bade them take anyting in exchange fr peace. sparrows left. at dawn, the fdox realized what they hat taken: his beloved kit.
the fox pursied the sparrows through barren land and wood, found tham among the branches of a gnraled tree. snatched two, asked: where is my kit?
given to kingdom of night, where the ??
so the fox passed light -> dark, injured.
in the keep of dusk soveregn found his kit, uncovered fate. kit now shared curse of sovereign, now full of death and cold
begged: father, save me from this cursed existence
silver fox, full of tears and anguish, did.
as the fox's anguished howl shattered the night, and his heart.
father entered the kingdom, but a phantom of rage vanished into the night.
true: stanim, ireena
halftrue: areia, quiyra, jasper
false: eliza
actually: true

ireena:
wheni was a child, my father took me&bro to tranquil lake. remember sun, lapping waves
something broke silence. low growl: a beast emerging from the fog, a huge wolf. its eyes: yellow,cold,hungry. father: run, ireena!
she did. wolf followed, snarls echoing. branches whipping at ireena, thorns at feet
only much later, when heart and wolf steps quiet, she stops.
by then, though, woods strange,father's shouts faded.
strange mist, shadows everywhere
step forward, hand into fog: wolf made of mist leapt forth, jaws devouring her!
everything black. next thing: awoke in own bed, father humming in kitchen
dont know how got there, or what happened, bt can still remember teeth clearly as ever.
true: areia, stanim
halftrue: quiyra
false: jasper, eliza, arturi
actually: false, it was a dream! no lakes near barovia, never saw a direwolf till recently.

jasper wins! he gets the stuff.
arturi's book: *A Study of the Werewolf's Curse*, by Dr Rudolf van Richten

it's quite late now, so we go to sleep.

## Day 2
we wake quite early, as the tents don't filter the daylight very well.

the vistani also wake up. washing in the river, sound&smell of cooking

ireena also wakes up, with severe bed head.

quiyra checks the weather: cloudy with probable light rain.

oliver and jasper know about van Richten: he's a very famous monster hunter. Oliver knows: undead slayer, Jasper: more general. Quite strong too. He's rather secretive, though.

Quiyra asks Arturi: do you have a message for van Richten? yes: come find me. Q: and what does he look like? A: age unsure, 50ish maybe. slightly pointy ears. round glasses. slick gray hair, gray muttonchop beard and goatee, sharp features, pointy nose

we prepare for departure again. as we do, madam eva approaches us. she wishes us a good morning, hopes we had a good night's sleep
she asks a favor of us: a small velvet pouch, which she hands to jasper. this pouch has 10 gp. would you mind buying a toy from bliski toys in vallaki, for my greatgrandniece arabell. feel free to keep the change. she's in the vallaki encampment SW of vallaki. can you deliver it in two days? because, that's her 10th nameday. she's particularly fond of bliski's toys, so anything will do. she enjoys collecting them.
she would go herself, but long journeys are just too taxing for her old bones.
jasper accepts the charge.

eva: It's been a pleasure knowing you, and I'm sure we will meet again. Have a safe travel.

tentative plan: go to the [Abbey of Saint Markovia](../Places/Abbey%20of%20Saint%20Markovia.md) after we're done in Vallaki, since it's the one concrete location mentioned in our fortunes.

we take off. walk back to crossroads, take the other route.

the remains from our battle with the birdthings are still there.

back to the Ivlis crossroads. The gallows are empty at first. through the mist we see coming toward us a skeletal warhorse and rider, clad in ruined chainmail.

the rider holds up a rusted lantern that sheds no light. we briefly discuss a detour through the woods, but decide against it.

quiyra steps out and hails the rider. it doesn't respond. however, before it gets out of reach entirely, we rally our wits and decide to stop it.

combat!
round 1 (surprise!)
jasper: move, nothing
quiyra: thorn whip, 24 hit for 6 p, pull the skeleton out of its saddle. move back.
oliver: walk up to the skeleton, daggerstab skeleton, 25 hit for 6 p + 8 radiant. it's gone. step to skeleton, offhand attack at skele horse
ireena: also surprised
areia: rage, summon glaive, run up to horse, reckless atk: miss (distracted by a stupid fucking tree that is in the way)
horse: surprised
round 2
jasper: box attack horse, 25 hit for 9 force. handxbow attack horse, 22 hit for 9 p. it collapses.

done.

quiyra uses mold earth to make a pit in which we can burn the bones.
