## Day 1 (still)
ismark goes upstairs to check on ireena
quiyra uses the privacy to tell the rest of the party about the conversation between Ireena and Ismark about her leaving

we discuss having a map
we discuss levels of force in case we run into a fight

ismark returns, reports that ireena snuck away. would we mind fetching her?
he says she's most likely at Lugdana's Knoll, a small hill in the northern part of the village.
q: does he know if there's an item she would've been carrying or wearing? i: yeah, her armor.

we go there. we traverse pretty much the whole village as we do. pass in front of the church.

areia: who can track? q: i can

sea of tall grass north of the village, gentle hill rising before us. bordered on the far side by the Svalich wood. plants with wide feathery flowers and a sweet earthy scent within the grass. a lone tree standing atop the hill, beneath it: a female figure, her gaze fixed on the ground. it's ireena.
oliver approaches her with the rest of us staying back. he quietly joins her. she has a trowel and she's digging a hole between the tree's roots. doesn't notice oliver until he sits down. looks at him and smiles, greets him. O: gave your brother a bit of a scare there! Ireena: I just wanted to retrieve a little thing before departure. she keeps digging, eventually finds something hard: a small wooden box. "there it is." she takes it, opens it, gently browses the contents: a small silver bracelet with gemstones, a pressed flower (aster), a wooden char? in the shape of another flower (yarrow), and a kerchief with flower pattern. Ireena: "sorry for calling you Oli, I just heard Areia do so and thought it was cute." he doesn't mind. she explains: this is her memory box, which she buried here w/ her mother. she wanted to give him this (the bracelet), some sort of upfront payment for the travel. he refuses, says there are some things that should be kept sacred. she doesn't push it. this (something else?) is the only thing she has any real bond with. her father said she had this with her when he found her; she's adopted, actually. Corina, her mother, wanted to keep it as a memento of her miracle child, as she was unable to have more children after Ismark. Ireena herself isn't strongly attached to the bracelet. She gives it to Oliver for safekeeping. The bracelet is quite pretty, though tarnished. intricate pattern of moon and stars exterior, moonstone gem center, five lapis lazuli stars. inside, a tiny cursive script: *Tatyana, may you find your path, and may you find light even in the darkest places. Mother and Father.* (in Common)

she's ready to go, wants to say goodbye to her brother first. clearly nervous.

she and oliver rejoin us. she apologizes for the delay. back to the house we go. she walks slowly, reluctant? as she does, we see her looking around, drinking in her home for one last time. Ismark waits outside the mansion, talking to people. As we approach, he looks at us and smiles at them, saying "we'll get back to it later, i have one important thing to attend to." those two people - armed, armored - leave. he looks at us, smiling, waiting for Ireena to approach. He gently grabs her hands, gives her a kiss on the cheek, says "Be safe, sister. I will see you soon, when things finally get better." She mumbles some words, then "Thank you for everything. I love you." they hug, a long while, then separate and exchange something like a formal bow. She waves her hand goodbye, teary-eyed but smiling at us. We're all ready, so we're finally off.

We will rely on her for guidance; it will be her pleasure. We set off west, fog creeping around our feet as we walk on the old Svalich road. the same grass as before, stretching from the forest to the Iviliss river. The sky above us is a dull gray, heavy clouds that promise rain, and it's not long before we can see an old arched stone bridge in the distance that spans the clear blue river ahead. We cross it and find ourselves on a muddy road that winds through the trees. trees press close, cast deep shadows that carve dark gouges across the road.

after traveling for Â½hour:

coming from the bushes, we hear a muffled and diffuse voice: "who goes there? name yourself!" Areia takes out her weapon and asks if she should investigate. Oliver calls back: we're just going from Barovia to Vallaki, nothing special. "Are you aligned with the devil?" O: no, not at all. Two heads pop up in the distance, aiming longbows at us (but not drawn). Two humans in common clothes and light leather armor. They start slowly approaching. They lower their weapons and speed up to a normal pace once they recognize Ireena. Areia puts her glaive away. Q: "Ireena, you know these people?" I: "yeah, they're Kereza (f) and Korga (m). two of our barovian scouts." They approach and shake hands with Ireena, ask where she's going. she explains, and tells them who we are/why we're with her. They tell us a word of advice: keep on the road, never go into the woods. It's dangerous. Only dead and dangerous stuff walks the woods. And most importantly, be warned that the Devil's spies are numerous - they include wolves, bats, even trees. They've seen trees animate, with hostile intent. We wish each other a safe trip. They say they're looking for some people, the Lansten family: 2 parents, 3 young children (1girl, 2boys). "If you see them, point them towards us - towards Barovia." They let us pass.

we travel further. as we progress, the expected rain indeed starts comng down, as a drizzle. the road meets the river again, which is now wider and calmer. we can see the reflection of the trees and fog on the surface; the sound of the river mingles with the rustling of leaves and drizzle of rain, with no birdsong to break the silence.
the river bends once more and the woods surround the road once again.
trees pull away, tall cliff at base of foggy mountain. air cold and damp. soft wisps of fog around base of cliff.
wooden gallows creaking in the chill wind, frayed legth of rope hanging on it.

signpost, 3 directions:
 - barovia village, east
 - ravenloft/vallaki, SW
 - tser pool, NW

across from the gallows, low wall around small spot of graves.

we agree not to linger for overlong and follow the sign to Tser Pool

sounds of horsedrawn carriage approaching through the fog, toward us, from Tser Pool. after a little time, we see a large black carriage drawn by two black horses, snorting puffs of steamy breath into the chill air around. A man is driving the carriage: very handsome, dressed in fine and noble clothes. long blond hair in a ponytail, sharp and handsome features ruined by a prominent red scar on his left cheek. We hear Ireena gasp loudly. The carriage comes to a stop, the driver releases the rains. A man steps down, not looking at us. Quiyra shakes Ireena out of her stupor, and Ireena takes off at a run. Quiyra shouts "jump on!", turns into a riding horse, and gallops after Ireena.

Appearing from the fog are two dire wolves, snarling and blocking our escape path. The driver doesn't seem to care. As he opens the carriage, he bows very deep. A tall, gaunt man dressed in finery befitting a man of royal stature steps out. Black cloak neatly around shoulders, red broach at the neck. Longsword at his hip, scarlet tunic w/ intricate sign, black hair pulled back into a sharp and immaculate widow's peak. eyes dark. Fingernails form long and elegant claws. Skin pale, unnaturally so; eyes glint with a deep, intelligent hunger. Quiyra turns back into herself.

Ireena averts her eyes from the man's gaze, and she chokes out: "don't look into his eyes!" He briefly looks at Ireena, and smiles coldly.

he introduces himself, he's strahd. pleasure to meet him. his friends have told him much about us. the wonderful job we've done at the house. feeling from his eyes: a butcher looking at an intriguing but inanimate cut of meat, predator looking at prey. he's introducing himself as lord of this domain, it would be quite rude not to! he gives us the shallowest of bows. He informs areia her kind isn't common around here, she'll find some eyes on her. She replies "I always do! ;)", and he seems amused.

He notes our escape from death house. Q asks if the basket was from him: of course! though he didn't deliver it personally.

He asks how we've found our stay here so far. it's aight, locals are nice. Q finds the atmosphere oddly comforting. 

He asks if we're familiar with the ruling of land. None of us are, really.

Suppose we were in his place. That a man, say Ismark, spites him by keeping his sister from him. Why should he, his lord, not punish him for his disloyalty?

We offer various counterarguments:
 - Oliver: surely there's more important things?
 - Q: not sure Ismark could keep Ireena from anything against her will.

Strahd: the last outsider fostered sedition and disloyalty. Why should he not just dispose of us before we do the same?

Q points out that surely he knows better than to generalize from just one example

Areia jumps in: people aren't objects! that's really dehumanizing. He almost laughs.

He has one last question. He has claimed Ireena, and twice marked her as his own. Why shouldn't he take her to Ravenloft as his own? We counter: she didn't consent, and does he really think she would just do as he wants then?

He agrees, this is why he hasn't taken her yet. Q: Why ask, then? S: assessing you. Ruling over a land can be boring, sometimes. It entertains him to get to know every single guest of his. Q: this is an impulse I can understand.

A: more questions? S: no. I am sure we will meet again. Until then, farewell.
The wolves move toward the carriage. As he steps back in, the wolves move to flank the carriage as a guard. The driver returns to his seat, and resumes driving. He shoos us out of the way, and we comply. They ride away into the mists, towards Ravenloft/Vallaki. Oliver stares off after it, purple glow emanating from his dagger.

We ask Ireena what Strahd meant with the "claiming". I: sorry for having kept this from you. fiddles with her scarf. He bit me, twice. I have no memories of what happened, only what my father and brother told me. Apparently I was in some sort of mystical state. I don't know that much about vampires, but I know this is a power they have. It seems I considered myself to be bit twice. The reason I must find a safe place is that I've been told the third bite is the last.

Areia asks Ireena if she wants to take a break, or keep going. She wants to keep going. Q points out: based on past experience with the Vistani, we'll probably get a warm welcome.

as we move to depart the crossroads, we hear a different noise: creaking behind us, coming from the gallows. there now hangs a lifeless gray body. the breeze turns the figure slowly so it can fix its dead eyes upon us. doesn't look like anyone we know... except for areia, who sees a striking resemblance: herself! We figure this out. On Quiyra advice, Areia shouts at it. It doesn't react.

We deliberate what to do for a spell. Oliver tosses a dart at it, and finds it's not undead. As he hits it, the whole thing just crumbles and dissolves. He walks over and grabs his dart out of the pile of dust.

We resume walking toward Tser Pool.

We have a quick (and morbid) conversation about how Areia might die, or be executed. She doesn't think she'd get hanged.

The path follows the river. After another 50 minutes, we hear the sound of a distressed bird calling from above. It's a raven with blue-tipped wings, crashing at our feet, wounded. It's pierced by several spikes/barbs, made of silver. Soon, other creatures land in front of us: artificial quasi-birds, made of wood, animal skin, burlap, and black raven feathers. A very big one, scarecrow wth ravenish face, wings of cloth and raven feathers, dozens of tiny silver barbs. And a couple of smaller ones. combat! order:

Quiyra drops the web and goes with Jasper to check on the bird. Jasper carefully pulls the spikes out of the raven, with help from Oliver. Quiyra conjures some goodberries and feeds one to the raven. It's skittish at first, but gladly accepts the berry. It looks much better than before.

Jasper finishes pulling the spikes out of himself, and gets the rest of the goodberries for a full heal.

The raven caws at Quiyra from within her hands, and she deposits it on her shoulder. Ireena asks if we're alright; we are. Is she?

We move the things' remains to the side of the road, then get moving again.
